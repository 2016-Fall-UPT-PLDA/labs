# Week 3 - October 11th, 2016

Next week we will be going into `Monads` properly. Please read (at least) the following sections (i.e. if a new title appears, you can stop reading and go to the next link) from Learn You A Haskell:
- [Type Classes 101](http://learnyouahaskell.com/types-and-typeclasses#typeclasses-101)
- [Function Composition](http://learnyouahaskell.com/higher-order-functions#composition)
- [Type Classes 102](http://learnyouahaskell.com/making-our-own-types-and-typeclasses#typeclasses-102)
- [The Functor Typeclass](http://learnyouahaskell.com/making-our-own-types-and-typeclasses#the-functor-typeclass)
- [A Fistfull of Monads](http://learnyouahaskell.com/a-fistful-of-monads), up until, and including the do notation section.

You can also check out the slides of a talk I gave at a Big Data meetup here in Timisoara: [Monads as Abstractions Over Control Flow](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_QySn48lza4ZjhHZkZvMTBBMFE). This is here mostly for the monad puns, the slides are of little help without the accompanying presentation.
