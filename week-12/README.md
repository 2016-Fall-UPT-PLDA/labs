Programming Language Wars
=====================

I like to start out from the paper ["Programming Language Wars" (2014) by Andreask Stefik and Stefan Hanenbers](http://dl.acm.org/authorize?N84615) in our discussion on programming language design. If the above link is broken, try picking out the paper from [Andreas Stefik's reasearch page](http://web.cs.unlv.edu/stefika/research.html).
